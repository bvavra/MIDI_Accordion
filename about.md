### History

The MIDI Accordion project started in early 2016 after succumbing to a burning desire to be able to play my favorite instrument whenever I wanted without disturbing anyone (like my downstairs neighbors, or my wife at 3:00 in the morning).  My original plan was just to make a box of buttons to simulate the left hand Stradella bass system so I can practice fingerings (and play a MIDI piano keyboard with my right hand at the same time if I so desired).  I didn't think it would be possible to build an entire fully-functional accordion by myself.

Then I found [AccordionMega](https://github.com/accordion-mega/AccordionMega/wiki/Accordion-Mega-story): a project to do *exactly what I really wanted.*  To be able to build my own MIDI accordion, and for under $100, seemed too good to be true.  So I gave it a shot and dove right in... and I *immediately* became overwhelmed.  Although I'm a software developer, I've never touched an Arduino before, nor have I ever read schematics or built circuits or performed any electrical engineering any kind.  I had [no idea what I was doing](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/234/765/b7e.jpg).

So I forked the [AccordionMega GitHub project](https://github.com/accordion-mega/AccordionMega) and read the wiki over and over, searching for the "Ah-ha!" moments that would help bring everything together.  I ran into several walls, though.  Links were broken, parts were deprecated, the schematics were drawn up in [EAGLE](https://cadsoft.io/) (which is [not free](https://cadsoft.io/pricing/)).  It was an uphill endeavor to say the least.

Eventually things started coming together.  I bought an [Arduino Getting Started Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HI0RYJK) and started tinkering.  I found replacement parts for the bluetooth transceiver and the barometric pressure sensor.  I downloaded datasheets and PDFs of instructions so I wouldn't lose them to the ever-changing void that is the internet.  And I logged *everything*: my hours, my parts, my prototypes, and the many, many pitfalls I stumbled upon along the way.  And now I'm paying all of that information forward to you.

### Anyone Can Do It

One of my goals for this project was not only to build an awesome MIDI instrument, but to put everything I learned along the way (and then some) in one place for others to follow.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm eternally grateful for [Dmitry's](https://github.com/accordion-mega) work, but for someone who knew nothing about electrical engineering the documentation was quite lacking, and I'm sure there are accordion players out there who would love to take on a project like this, but have even less experience than I did.  So I put everything I've done onto this project page in hopes that it helps empower other future projects from fellow accordionists.
